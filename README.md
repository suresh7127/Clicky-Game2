This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


<h1>Game-Clicky<h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The gameclicky is a web game application where users click images  in order to earn points.  You win the game whenever you have clicked .  
<h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>React.js- UI</li>
  <li>Bootstrap- CSS framework</li>
</ul>

<h2>About the Code</h2>
<h4>Getting Started</h4>
<p>First thing I did was create the React Client-side boilerplate by typing create-react-app Clicky-game in the command line.  Next, I changed into that directory by typing 'cd Clicky-game' in the terminal. After that I typed npm start to open the app in the browser.</p>
<h4>Starting to Code</h4>
<p>Create-react-app gives you a public folder with a basic index.html page, some basic css for the react template, an App.js file, index.js file, and some other boilerplate files.  I only had to alter one things in the index.html page: the title of my app. I either altered or completely changed the rest of the files, adding my own style.  The bulk of the code for this app was done in the src/components directory. </p>

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
